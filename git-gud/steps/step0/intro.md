# Scenario Description

This scenario is designed to help learners gain experience using Git as a version control system for projects that they are working on. 

Additionally, it covers the basics of working with remote Git repository hosting websites (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.). 


# Learning Goals

By the end of this scenario, learners should feel more confident with:

- articulating what Git is and why it is used for software development
- initializing a directory as a Git repository
- checking the status of the repository's working directory
- seeing the differences between versions of files
- staging changes to prepare them for commit
- committing changes to the head of a local repository
- connecting a local Git repository to a remote repository
- pushing local changes to a connected remote repository
- pulling changes down from a connected remote repository
