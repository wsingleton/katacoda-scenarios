# Version Control

When working on a software project, there are likely to be a lot of moving parts as well as people who will develop its various features. More often than not, individuals will work on different parts of the same project at the same time, independently of one another. Coordinating and integrating changes made across different versions of the project is exact the purpose of **version control**. Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to a project's codebase. 

A version control system (VSC) is a software tool that helps a team manage changes to a codebase as it is developed.  Developers use the version control software to record modifications made to the codebase into a tree-like data structure. During development mistakes will be made and when that happens, developers are able to inspect the exact moment when the mistake was made; allowing them to compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.


# Git 

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. While it is not the only VCS available, Git has pretty much established itself as the standard within the industry. 

This scenario's environment already had Git installed. Go ahead and type `git --version` in the editor check the installed version. You can also explore the docs for Git at [here](https://git-scm.com/docs).
