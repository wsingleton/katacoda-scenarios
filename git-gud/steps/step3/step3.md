# Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory

If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that projectâ€™s directory. In the editor type the following commands and note the output and results:

1. `cd study-cards`
2. `git init`
3. `git status`

The first command navigates us into the `study-cards` project directory. Once inside, the `git init` command initializes the directory as a Git repository by creating a `.git` directory within it. It is this directory that will contain all of the files necessary to maintain versions.
