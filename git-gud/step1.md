# Software Configuration Management

Software configuration management, or SCM, is the task of tracking and controlling changes for an application or suite of applications. The primary goals are to:

- identify all items that collectively define the software configuration
- manage changes to one or more of these items
- facilitate the construction of different versions of an application
- ensure that software quality is maintained as the configuration evolves over time


# Git 

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

This scenario's environment already had Git installed. Go ahead and type `git --version` in the editor to confirm. You can also explore the docs for Git at [here](https://git-scm.com/docs).
