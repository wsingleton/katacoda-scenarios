- articulating what Git is and why it is used for software development
- explaining/defining terms such as: *working directory*, *head*,
- initializing a directory as a Git repository
- checking the status of the repository's working directory
- seeing the differences between versions of files
- staging changes to prepare them for commit
- committing changes with a descriptive message
- connecting a local Git repository to a remote repository
- pushing local changes to a connected remote repository
- pulling changes down from a connected remote repository
