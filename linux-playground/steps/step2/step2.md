Most people are aware that a computer is made up of two main parts: *hardware* and *software*. 

The hardware is the physical pieces of the system. Some common examples of hardware and their basic purpose would be:

- *processor* (the part of the computer that performs calculations)
- *hard drive* (the long-term memory storage area)
- *RAM (random access memory)* (the short-term memory storage area)
- *power supply* (turns the AC from your wall outlet into DC)
- *peripherals* (input/output devices; keyboard, mouse, camera, speakers, microphone, etc.)
- *motherboard* (the main circuitboard that pulls all of the above together via cables and connectors)

Hardware on its own is not very useful, it needs software to allow for us to easily interface with it. The primary piece of software that helps us to do just that is the **operating system**. When a computer is powered on, a special software program called the **bootloader** is ran and it attempts to load the installed operating system. The core component of the operating system is called the **kernal**, which is responsible for translating commands recieved from applications running on the operating system into machine language that the hardware can understand and execute. To clarify, you can think of the operating system as the primary interface/translator between you (the user) and the hardware. It takes your inputs (provided via applications you run) and uses its kernal to perform the tasks you specified.

Finally, there is one more basic piece of software to discuss: the **shell**. This is a user program that exists within the operating system and represents the primary way for us, as users, to interface with the kernal. There are other terms you will hear used to describe this component of the operating system, and while there are technically differences between these we can consider them practically synonymous for now:

- terminal
- console
- command-line
