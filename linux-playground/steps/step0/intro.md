# Scenario Description

This scenario is designed to help learners gain experience performing basic tasks within a Linux environment. This scenario will guide learners through the basic purposes of some important directories and files within the operating system. Additionally, the relationship between the hardware, operating system, and kernal will be explored.


# Learning Goals

By the end of this scenario, learners should feel more confident with:

- conceptualizing how the hardware, operating system, and kernal relate to one another
- articulating what Linux is and how it differs from other OSs like Windows and MacOS
- articulating the purpose of important directories (e.g. `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/bin/local`, etc.)
- listing all of the processes currently running within an environment
- using the `man` command to read documentation on various command line utilities
- navigating around various places within the operating system
- creating, listing the contents of, and deleting directories using the command line interface
- creating, modifying, and deleting files using the command line interface
- redirecting command output to various locations (e.g. `stdout`, a file, etc.)
- inspecting and modifying file permissions
- compressing and decompressing directories and their files
- fetching files from online resources
- searching file contents using the command line interface
- piping command output as input to other commands
